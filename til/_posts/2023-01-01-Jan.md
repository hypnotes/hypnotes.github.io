## Introduction 

Jumping into Hackathon, I have learned a great deal and had a chance to grasp overall view of how web is implemented.

However, I also suffered greatly; doing both frontend and backend without prior knowledge, implementing using stacks that I haven't even heard of..etc. 

Learning new concepts in a limited time was challenging, so I did not spend much time on it, rather, just rummaged through blogs and caught up with the very least I could, just so enough I was able to utilize it.

Therefore, I've made a list of concepts that I wanted to look further into after the hackathon, so that I will get a better insight on these new amazing topics.
