### Introduction

- Artificial Intelligence usually refers to Deep Learning these days
- Geoffrey E Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Yann LeCun -> Fathers of AI Deep Learning 

### Machine Learning 
1. Supervised Learning (Data + Labels), DEEPLEARNING
2. Unsupervised Learning (Data ONLY)
    - like training a baby
    - ex) Recommendation System
3. Reinforcement Learning 

### CNN vs RNN
- two major deep learning models

| Concolutional Neural Network ( CNN ) | Recurrent Neural Network ( RNN ) | 
|:--------------------------|:---------------------|
| Visual Information Learning        | Time-Series Information Learning | 
| Layers (Input, Concolutional, Pooling, Fully Connected, Output) | several neural network architecture connected by time |


### Deep Learning Types

- <strong>VISION</strong>
    - Object Recognition
    - Style Transfer
    - Deblurring and Denoising
    - Super-Resolution (enhancing)

- <strong>SPEECH AND LANGUAGE</strong>
    - Speech Recognition
    - Machine Translation
    - Information Retrieval

- <strong>GAN </strong>: (Generative Adversarial Network) 
    - traning both of **generator** and **discriminator**, 
      and then generates samples which are similar to the original samples
    - Performance Improvements via ***Competition***
